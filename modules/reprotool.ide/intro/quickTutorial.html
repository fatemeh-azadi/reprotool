		<h3>Quick 5-minutes tutorial</h3>
		
		<h4>First install the example projects into your workspace.</h4>
		<p>
			<ol>
			<li>Select the <b><i>File / New / Example...</i></b> command from the main menu.</li>
			<li>Now select the <b>Reprotool example projects</b> wizard and click <b><i>Next</i></b>.</li>
			<li>Click <b>Finish</b>.</li>
			</ol>
			
			The <em>Reprotool</em> example projects should now be installed in your workspace.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Familiarise yourself with the <em>Citimap example</em> project.</h4>
		<p>
			<ol>
			<li>Double click the <b><i>cityMap.swproj</i></b> in the <em>Citymap example</em> project directory.</li>
			<li>Make sure the outline view is displayed.</li>
			<li>Double-click the use-cases in the project editor. A new use-case editor will fire up
				where you can view the selected use-case.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		
		<h4>Introduction to the model-checking in <em>Reprotool</em></h4>
		<p>
			The <em>Citymap example</em> project contains already some annotations. You can think of
			<em>Reprotool</em> annotations as boolean variables. Use-cases in <em>Reprotool</em>
			projects consist of use-case steps. You can assign annotaions to individual use-case steps.
			When the <em>Reprotool</em> performs model checking, it firstly initializes all annotaion
			variables to boolean value false. It then starts executing use-cases. Executing a use-case
			means executing its use-case steps. If a step is executed that has an annotation, the
			value of that annotation variable is changed to true.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			In every <em>Reprotool</em> project, there is already a set of predefined annotations that
			you can use. You can, however, define new annotations. The annotaions in a <em>Reprotool</em>
			project must adhere to the rules that are defined in the project as a set of
			<em>temporal logic formulas</em>.
			The predefined annotations already have some predefined default
			behaviour. One of the predefined annotations is the <b><i>create</i></b> annotation. One
			of the rules that defines its behaviour in <em>Reprotool is</em> this:
			<ol>
				<li>You can not create the same object more than once.</li>
			</ol>
			In the next section of this tutorial, you will run the model checking on the <em>Citymap
			example</em> project and the model checker will generate a counter-example where you can
			see that there is a possible execution scenario where the <b><i>zoom</i></b> object is
			created more than once. The generated counter-example contains the trace of this execution
			scenario.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Run the model-check of the <em>Citymap example</em> project.</h4>
		<ol>
		<li>Right-click the <b><i>cityMap.swproj</i></b> file in the project explorer and run the command
		<b><i>Convert SW project to SMV</i></b> from the context menu.</li>
		<li>Notice in the project explorer, that a new file <b><i>cityMap.swproj.nusmv</i></b> has been generated.
			View the file. If you are asked whether you want to add the <em>Xtext nature</em> to
			the project, click yes.</li>
		<li>Right-click the <b><i>cityMap.swproj.nusmv</i></b> file in the project explorer and run the
			<b><i></i>Run NuSMV verification</b> command from the context menu.</li>
		<li>The counter-example trace has been printed on the console output. Also notice in the
			project explorer, that a new file <b><i>cityMap.swproj.cexmp</i></b> has been generated.</li>
		<li>View the generated counter-example file <b><i>cityMap.swproj.cexmp</i></b>.</li>
		<li>Notice in the outline-view of the counter-example trace, that the <b><i>create_zoom<i></b>
		annotation appears two times in the red line that shows the execution path. This is a
		violation of one of the default rules that bind the <b><i></i>create</b> annotation.</li>
		</ol>
