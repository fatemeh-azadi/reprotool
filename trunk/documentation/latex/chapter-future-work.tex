\section{Future work}

\subsection{Automatic annotation derivation}
Current version of the Reprotool's linguistic analysis doesn't add annotations
used by formal analysis to the use case steps. Some of the annotations could be
infered (for example "Abort" annotation).

\subsection{EMF Model refinement and simplification}
Currently EMF model contains different model classes for marking of the
parts of the sentence (text ranges) and annotations describing properties of
the whole use case step. What's more - marked parts need additional classes
for binding of the marked text and described entity.
Concept of the "annotation" should be generalized so that core model would be
more simple and independant on the implementation of the added annotation.
This would allow to refine model into several smaller plugins.

\subsection{Better integration with CI build and QA tools}
Altough automated build of the project was partially successful - most of the
plugins are built on CI server Jenkins, project would benefit by employing
fully automated build and deploy of the artifacts. Additional employment of the 
tools for static analysis of the code (Findbugs, Checkstyle) would be beneficial.
