\section{Create a new \emph{Reprotool} project}

In this section we will walk through the process of creating a new simple \emph{Reprotool} project named \emph{PostOffice}.

\subsection{\emph{PostOffice} project description}
We will create a simple \emph{PostOffice} project that describes how a letter is written and then taken to the post office.
Our simple project will contain three use-cases and two actors. The \emph{PostOffice} project contains these use-cases:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item {\bf buyEnvelope}
 \item {\bf writeLetter}
 \item {\bf takeLetter}
\end{enumerate}

The \emph{PostOffice} project has these two actors specified:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item {\bf Peter} He writes a letter.
 \item {\bf officer} He works at the post office.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{The \emph{buyEnvelope} use-case}

This use-case has the following structure:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Peter goes to the shop
 \item Peter stands the queue
 \item Peter buys the envelope
 \item Peter goes home
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{The \emph{writeLetter} use-case}
\begin{enumerate}

 \item Peter looks at his watches.

    Peter does not have enough free time:
    \begin {enumerate}
      \item Peter does something more important.
    \end {enumerate}

 \item Peter writes the letter.

 \item Peter checks if he has a spare envelope.
    
    Peter does not have a spare envelope:
    \begin {enumerate}
      \item Peter leaves the building.
      \item Include use-case buyEnvelope.
    \end {enumerate}

 \item Peter opens the envelope.

 \item Peter puts the letter into the envelope and closes it.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Create a \emph{Reprotool} project}
Create a new \emph{Reprotool} project using the command
\begin{verbatim}
 File / New / Reprotool Project
\end{verbatim}

A \emph{new project} dialog fires up. Enter the project name \emph{postOffice} and press \emph{Enter}. The new \emph{postOffice}
\emph{Reprotool} project has been created. You can view it now in the \emph{Project Explorer}. Now the \emph{project editor} has
started and we can start editing our (now empty) project.

The first thing we are going to do is to add actors to our project. You add actors by clicking the green \emph{plus} sign above the
\emph{Actors} field in the \emph{project editor}. Now please add the two actors to our project.

\subsection{Add use-cases to our project}
Now we are going to add the use-cases to our project. We will describe the process in greater detail for the use-case
\emph{writeLetter}. You add a use-case by clicking the \emph{plus} sign above the Use-cases field of the \emph{Project editor}.
After clicking on the \emph{plus} sign, the \emph{Use-case} editor has started. Now we are going to edit the use-case.

Firstly, enter the use-case name \emph{writeLetter} and think of a suitable \emph{description} of the use-case.
Then select the \emph{Peter} as the \emph{primary actor} of the use-case.

Now it is time to add the individual use-case steps to our use-case. Notice that the use-case by default already contains one single
use case step. You add other steps by right-clicking on use-case step and select the
\begin{verbatim}
New Sibling / Use Case Step
\end{verbatim}
 command. Now proceed by firstly adding the steps of the \emph{main scenario} only. That is, add the following steps to the use-case:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Peter looks at his watches.
 \item Peter writes the letter.
 \item Peter checks if he has a spare envelope.
 \item Peter opens the envelope.
 \item Peter puts the letter into the envelope and closes it.
\end{enumerate}

Now we will add an \emph{extension scenario} to the use-case step 1 (Peter looks at his watches). An \emph{extension scenario} is an
ordered set of steps than can be attached to some use-case step. The steps of an extension scenario are executed \emph{after} the execution
of the associated step if the associated condition is met. So now right-click the first use-case step and select this command:
\begin{verbatim}
 New Child / Extensions scenario
\end{verbatim}
A new \emph{extension scenario} has been created. It has the label \emph{1a (ext.)} because it is attached to the use-case step with label
\emph{1}. The created scenario by default contains a single step. Enter this text in the use-case editor right next to the label
\emph{1a (ext.)}
\begin{verbatim}
Peter does not have enough free time:
\end{verbatim}
Then fill the single use-case step of our extension scenario with this text:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Peter does something more important.
\end{enumerate}

Now create an extension scenario to the step three in a same way. But now attach this text to the extension scenario:
\begin{verbatim}
Peter does not have a spare envelope:
\end{verbatim}

Add a second step to the extension scenario so that it is 2 steps long. And fill the steps with this text:
\begin {enumerate}
 \item Peter leaves the building.
 \item Include use-case buyEnvelope.
\end {enumerate}

Now we are finished with the \emph{writeLetter} use-case. Proceed in a similar way and create the other two missing use-cases.
Select \emph{Peter} as the \emph{primary actor} of the use-case \emph{buyEnvelope} and select the \emph{Officer} as the primary actor
of the \emph{takeLetter} use-case.

In the following figure you can view the \emph{PostOffice} project while editing the \emph{takeLetter} use-case.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Add \emph{actions} to the use-case steps}

In this step we will need the \emph{Sentence Analysis} view. You can display it by this command:
\begin{verbatim}
 Window / Show View / Other
\end{verbatim}

and select \emph{Reprotool} from the dialog box that appears. Now click on the \emph{Sentence Analysis} and click OK. This should make
the \emph{SentenceAnalysis view} visible.

\subsubsection{\emph{Actions} in the \emph{writeLetter} use-case}

Now we will define the \emph{Abort} action for the only use-case step of the first step extension scenario. Click on the use-case step
with label \emph{1a1} and select \emph{Abort} as \emph{Action Type} in the \emph{Sentence Analysis View}. You can view this situation
in the next picture:
