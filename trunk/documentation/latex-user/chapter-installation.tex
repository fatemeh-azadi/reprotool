\section{Installation}

Our project is distributed as stand-alone RCP application. Application was developed and tested on GNU/Linux 3.0.0 and Windows XP 32bit systems.\\

Application doesn't require installation, simply copy application from directory corresponding to your platform and execute launcher (e.g. \emph{reprotool.exe} on Windows).\\

Due to big memory consumption during linguistics analysis (e.g. models of the ling. tools) it is recommended to run this application with at least 1GB free operating memory.\\

If you encounter \verb|java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space| errors try adding following line into \verb|reprotool.ini| file.

\begin{verbatim}
-XX:MaxPermSize=256M
\end{verbatim}
