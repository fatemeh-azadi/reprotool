It is important to note that use cases show general or common situations particular to a specific use of
the products and services described. Actual needs and requirements vary from customer to customer and
business to business. The actual implementation of Cisco AON HSE differs accordingly.

Use Case 1: Provisioning Process
Use Case 1 describes creating a new mailbox to establish the electronic trading relationship between two
trading partners. See Figure 2-1.

Use Case 1: Provisioning Process

Figure 2-1

Use Case 1: Provisioning Process

The use case of establishing an electronic trading relationship between two trading partners follows
these steps:
Step 1

The administrator collects the trading partner and SLA information necessary for the particular
document exchange.

Step 2

The administrator creates a new mailbox using the Operations Management Console (OMC). This is a
mandatory step before any trading relationships can be configured for the purpose of document
exchange.

Step 3

When the mailbox is added, the OMC notifies the mailbox service that a new mailbox has been
requested.

Step 4

On receipt of this notification, the OMC creates a directory on the remote file system corresponding to
the mailbox ID and creates the appropriate directories (in, out, sent, pending, error) under the mailbox
ID directory.

Step 5

The mailbox service sends a confirmation message to the OMC that the mailbox was created.

Step 6

Using the previously agreed-upon SLAs between trading partners, the administrator configures the
trading relationship information using the OMC.

Step 7

The configuration information is pushed to the Cisco AON module and the mailbox service using a web
services (WS) call.

Use Case Examples
Use Case 2: Making a Benefits Eligibility Check

Step 8

Any required digital certificates are imported into the OMC console.

Use Case 2: Making a Benefits Eligibility Check
Use Case 2 describes sending a benefits eligibility check message to a trading partner. See Figure 2-2.
A pharmacy needs to make an electronic eligibility check with a pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) for
a customer.
The pharmacy has a system that outputs only CSV files. However, the PBM needs the files in HIPAA
X12 format (EDI ASC X12 270).
Figure 2-2

Use Case 2: Sending an Eligibility Check to a Trading Partner

This use case proceeds as shown in the following steps:
Step 1

The administrator configures the system to deposit an eligibility check file in the out directory of the
remote file server at a pharmacy.

Step 2

The mailbox service monitors the out directory of the remote file system at regularly scheduled intervals.
When new files are detected, the files are moved to the pending directory on the file system.

Step 3

The mailbox service initiates the AS2 file transfer.

Use Case Examples

Use Case 3: Receiving an Electronic Prescription

Step 4

Upon receipt of the mailbox service request, the Cisco AON module:
•

Determines the trading partner ID.

•

Validates the document.

•

Determines the correct transformation based on the source IP address (IP address of the pharmacy),
destination IP address (IP address of the PBM), and the source document type.

Step 5

AON retrieves the trading relationship information from the cache using the trading partner ID.

Step 6

The file is packaged in accordance with the SLA requirements stored in the trading relationship (for
example, compression, encryption, or a digital signature might be required).
In this case, it is transformed to the EDI ASC X12 270 data format.

Step 7

The file is then forwarded to the appropriate TP destination address (for the PBM) using an
HTTP/HTTPS POST operation.

Step 8

The Cisco AON module monitors the response. If the transaction requires a synchronous Message
Disposition Notification (MDN), the MDN signature is generated. The AON Module concludes the
initial web services request from the mailbox service, including any synchronous MDN and optional
status or error indications.

Step 9

When the MDN is received, the mailbox service moves the original file to the sent directory and places
a copy of the MDN with it.

Step 10

All events are sent by web services to the OMC, providing details of the transaction to the administrator.

Step 11

The transformed and encrypted file is stored on a shared, remote file system (not on AON) for use in
auditing and non-repudiation.

Use Case 3: Receiving an Electronic Prescription
Use Case 3 describes receiving an electronic prescription sent by an external trading partner. See
Figure 2-3.

Use Case Examples

Use Case 3: Receiving an Electronic Prescription

This use case proceeds as shown in the following steps:
Step 1

The Trading Partner sends an AS2 message by HTTP(S) POST to the Cisco AON module.

Step 2

The Cisco AON module validates that a recognized “AS2 To” and “AS2 From” pair is resolvable and
retrieves the trading relationship configuration from the cache based upon the “AS2 To” and “AS2 From”
identifiers.
According to information contained in the AS2 headers, the Cisco AON module can perform several
functions on the incoming file including unpacking, decompressing, decrypting, and verifying
signatures.

Step 3

After the file is unpacked, the resulting message is processed by the mailbox service, specifying the
target mailbox and MDN requirements in the SOAP header.

Step 4

The mailbox service deposits the file in the appropriate in directory and generates the MDN as
appropriate. If transformation of the document to another format is required, the document is
transformed.

Step 5

If a synchronous MDN is required, the MDN is sent from the AON node to the initiating trading partner's
AS2 gateway in the HTTP(S) response. If an asynchronous MDN is required, the Cisco AON module
sends the MDN over a separate HTTP request that is sent from the receiving end of the transaction.
