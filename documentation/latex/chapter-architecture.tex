\section{Modular Architecture}
%TODO: this section is a stub
Reprotool project can be seen as a collection of Eclipse plugins built upon Eclipse platform distributed together as a standalone RCP application.
List of plugins is presented in Appendix~\ref{sec:plugins}.

%Something about modularization of the application using OSGi.
Eclipse platform uses Equinox implementation of the OSGi. OSGi is a specification defining module system and service platform for the Java programming language.

%What are the benefits of using OSGi instead of plain Java.
In constrast to using plain java \verb|.jar| libraries OSGi bundles allow to specify required bundles and it's versions. They also allow developer to specify exported packages visible for use from other bundles providing better encapsulation for non-exported ones.

%Eclipse plug-ins and a summary of used concepts.
