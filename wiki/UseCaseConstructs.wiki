#summary Constructs used within use-case specification

= Introduction =

Here, we are gathering possible constructs that appear in use-case specifications. They won't be necessarily supported by the ReProTool prototype. However, we should be aware of them.

= List of constructs =

== Scope ==
Scope of a use-case can be company, system or component.

== Interests ==
Some description about interests of all stakeholders. Most of the sentences are similar to _"Someone want something"_ e.g. _"Company want to accurately record transactions"_.

  * we could check if for all "wants" there is at least one requirement

== Preconditions/Postconditions ==
  * *precoditions* describe situation that should hold before the scenario can even begin and are *not tested* within the scenario.
  * should not describe obvious conditions
  * should not add "useless noise"
  * should describe some "alerts"

== References within steps ==
In some specifications, there are use-case steps that contain references to other use-case steps:
  * looping a range of steps: e.g. "If some condition holds, repeat steps 2-3"
  * conditional jump: e.g. "if something happens, continue with step 4"
