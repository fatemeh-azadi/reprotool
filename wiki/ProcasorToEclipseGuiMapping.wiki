#summary GUI used in reprotool project.

= Introduction =

This page describes GUI in the developed reprotool project and shows mapping from the procasor project. Reader should have at least basic user experience with procasor project.

= Application GUI =

== Application basic view structure ==

The goal of the GUI mapping is tight integration with eclipse platform and extension of the existing views and components. For example, standard console view will be used to show the output of the linguistic tools.

Reprotool perspective will divide space into two halves - left will be occupied by use case editor, right by the supportings views.

== Project overview ==

_Use case step editor_ will be similar to editor used in procasor. It should provide extension point for linguistic tools to change color of the tick mark.

TODO: variations - do they have meaning for use case in general or for procases only ?

The view _Project overview_ will show description of the whole project, list of the project entities (actors, stackholders) and use cases. Composed entities will be shown in hierarchical view.

TODO: Are conceptual objects needed ? Replace with actors & stakeholders ?

In procasor are use cases bound to (procase) use case model. But this 
functionality seems to be important only for behavioral protocol generation.

Therefore it should be moved into _use cases models_, which will be included in _procase plugin_. Filtering of the use cases according to model may be added to the _view menu_ in _project overview_.

== Parse tree ==

TODO: Extension points of the _parse tree view_.

== Input from text editor ==

To input use case steps from text file standard text editor will be opened under _use case step editor_. Text selected with mouse should be added as use case into _use case step editor_ when user uses keyboard shortcut.
