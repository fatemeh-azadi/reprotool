#summary This page is intended for reprotool developers as a guide to set their environment.

Note:The following steps were tested on _Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Lucid Lynx, kernel 2.6.32-27-generic i686 with 4GiB RAM_.

= Eclipse =
Download and install Eclipse Helios 3.6 from http://eclipse.org/downloads/, choose
_Eclipse Modeling Tools (includes Incubating components)_.

=== Subclipse SVN plugin ===
This step is optional, you could easily work with command-line-based SVN client.
To install Subclipse go to `Help -> Eclipse Marketplace` and search for "Subclipse".

Subclipse requires native JavaHL library. This can be installed on Ubuntu using:
`sudo apt-get install libsvn-java`

=== Window Builder Pro (optional) ===
Window Builder Pro is used for visual development of GUI parts (dialogs, perspectives,...). 
Install the plugin from update site (`Help -> Install new software`), enter location described at http://code.google.com/intl/cs-CZ/javadevtools/download-wbpro.html.

== Packages ==
Install packages "Eclipse Plug-in Development Environment" and "Eclipse RCP Plug-in Developer Resources" as described at http://www.vogella.de/articles/EclipseRCP/article.html#eclipseinstallation_download in chapter 2.2

= Project setup =
The whole SVN structure can be checked out manually from SVN to an external directory outside of the Eclipse workspace. The sub-projects located inside the checked-out directory can be separately imported to your Eclipse workspace using `File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace`. Although more complicated, this approach gives you additional flexibility and can be easily combined with the Subclipse SVN plugin.

Checkout project sources as described on
[http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/reprotool/source/checkout Checkout] page.

Pick a sub-project to import, e.g. `modules/ide`. Import project to your workspace as described above: `File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace`. Navigate to the sub-project directory (e.g. `modules/ide`). Also make sure the _Copy projects into workspace_ checkbox *is not checked* because we *don't want to copy* the project's content to the workspace, we want to modify the original files in the checked-out directory.

Try launching of the plugin: Double click on `plugin.xml` and push play button in upper right corner. New instance of eclipse should start, inside this started IDE select `Window -> Open perspective -> Other -> reprotool`.
