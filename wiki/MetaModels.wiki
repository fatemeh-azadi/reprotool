= Introduction =

Here is the ongoing discussion about the meta-models that we are going to use in our project.

= Parts of the Meta-Model =

The whole !ReProTool meta-model consists of several smaller meta-models divided into separate packages. Each package should encapsulate a certain aspect of the intended application.

== The Core ==
Describes the concept of traceability links used throughout the whole transformation pipeline.

== Files and Documents ==
Represents input files. In the initial phase only plan text files and java source files.

== Structural Artefacts ==
=== Generic Document Structure ===
Textual documents will be split into sections and further to paragraphs. Some paragraphs might be later identified as requirements or even as a special type of requirements such as use-cases. The identification will be automatic or manual.

=== Abstract Syntax of Source Code ===
In the initial phase, only Java source files will be parsed and the information about classes and methods will be extracted. These artefacts will be later connected with requirements.

== Software Engineering Artefacts ==
Contains sub-models describing different aspects of the software engineering domain:
 * Requirements Model
 * Domain Model
 * Behaviour Model
 * Component Model
